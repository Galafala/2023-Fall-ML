|Course Description|	This course covers the theory and practical algorithms for machine learning from a variety of perspectives. Typical tasks for machine learning are the classification of data, automatic regression, and unsupervised model fitting. Topics covered in this course include: statistical learning methods, shrinkage regression, principle component analysis, decision tree learning, support vector machines, artificial neural network, k-means, k-nearest neighbor, and etc. Short theoretical and programming assignments will be given. Students will also work on final projects of their choice.|
|Course Objective	|This course is designed to give a thorough grounding in the methodologies, technologies, mathematics and algorithms currently needed by people who do research in machine learning.|
